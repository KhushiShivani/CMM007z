    <h1>The Magical World of Cheese!</h1>
    <Img src="lab3/Lab4/images/cheese pic.jpg"> <p>Cheese is nutritious food made mostly from the milk of cows but also
    other mammals, including sheep, goats, buffalo, reindeer, camels and yaks. Around 4000 years ago people have started
    to breed animals and process their milk. That's when the cheese was born.</p>
